React Password Maker is a reusable React component that you can use in your React projects. It allows you to create a random password using uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as numbers. Just input the length of your password from 1 to 50 characters in length, and click the button to generate your password. A copy-to-clipboard feature allows you to copy the generated password to your clipboard. Additionally, error messages inform the user if what was inputted does not fall within the required parameters.
